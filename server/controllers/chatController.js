// Handles logic for creating and managing chats.
import Chat from '../models/Chat.js';
import User from '../models/User.js';

export const accessChat = async (req, res, next) => { /* ... logic is the same ... */ };
export const fetchChats = async (req, res, next) => { /* ... logic is the same ... */ };

// Note: The internal logic of these functions doesn't change, only the surrounding module syntax.
// I've omitted the function bodies for brevity, but they are identical to the previous answer.
